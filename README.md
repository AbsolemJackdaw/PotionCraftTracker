# PotionCraftTracker

Welcome to the PotionCraft Tracker

This little, simple, Java program has been written by me as a means to keep track of what potions sell the best.

starting up the program will show you all available potion names and the commands to edit the 
tracking map of potions you have added. 

it comes with a save and load feature, which saves your progress to a local file, in the same space the jar is 
launched in. 

the zip comes with a batch file to run the jar. simply unzip contents in a folder and run the batch file called
tracker.bat
